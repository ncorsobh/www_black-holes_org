  Cosmic Explorer is a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave
  observatory that is being designed in the 2020s and is envisioned to
  begin operations in the 2030s together with the Einstein Telescope
  in Europe. The Cosmic Explorer concept currently consists of two
  widely separated L-shaped observatories in the United States, one
  with 40 km-long arms and the other with 20 km-long arms. This order
  of magnitude increase in scale with respect to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
  observatories will, together with technological improvements,
  deliver an order of magnitude greater astronomical reach, allowing
  access to gravitational waves from remnants of the first stars and
  opening a wide discovery aperture to the novel and unknown. In
  addition to pushing the reach of gravitational-wave astronomy,
  Cosmic Explorer endeavors to approach the lifecycle of large
  scientific facilities in a way that prioritizes mutually beneficial
  relationships with local and Indigenous communities. This article
  describes the (scientific, cost and access, and social) criteria
  that will be used to identify and evaluate locations that could
  potentially host the Cosmic Explorer observatories.

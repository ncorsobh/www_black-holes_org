  Recent efforts to numerically simulate compact objects in
  alternative theories of gravity have largely focused on the time-
  evolution equations. Another critical aspect is the construction of
  constraint-satisfying initial data with precise control over the
  properties of the systems under consideration. Here, we augment the
  extended conformal thin sandwich framework to construct
  quasistationary initial data for black hole systems in scalar Gauss-
  Bonnet theory and numerically implement it in the open-source
  spectre code. Despite the resulting elliptic system being singular
  at black hole horizons, we demonstrate how to construct numerical
  solutions that extend smoothly across the horizon. We obtain
  quasistationary scalar hair configurations in the test-field limit
  for black holes with linear/angular momentum as well as for black
  hole binaries. For isolated black holes, we explicitly show that the
  scalar profile obtained is stationary by evolving the system in time
  and compare against previous formulations of scalar Gauss-Bonnet
  initial data. In the case of the binary, we find that the scalar
  hair near the black holes can be markedly altered by the presence of
  the other black hole. The initial data constructed here enable
  targeted simulations in scalar Gauss-Bonnet simulations with reduced
  initial transients.

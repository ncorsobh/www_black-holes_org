  In this chapter, we provide an overview of the physics of colliding
  black holes and neutron stars and of the impact of neutrinos on
  these systems. Observations of colliding neutron stars play an
  important role in nuclear astrophysics today. They allow us to study
  the properties of cold nuclear matter and the origin of many heavy
  elements (gold, platinum, uranium). We show that neutrinos
  significantly impact the observable signals powered by these events
  as well as the outcome of nucleosynthesis in the matter that they
  eject into the surrounding intergalactic medium.

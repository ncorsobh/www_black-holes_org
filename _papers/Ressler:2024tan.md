  Supermassive binary black holes in galactic centers are potential
  multimessenger sources in gravitational waves and electromagnetic
  radiation. To find such objects, isolating unique electromagnetic
  signatures of their accretion flow is key. With the aid of three-
  dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations
  that utilize an approximate, semianalytic, superimposed spacetime
  metric, we identify two such signatures for merging binaries. Both
  involve magnetic reconnection and are analogous to plasma processes
  observed in the solar corona. The first, like colliding flux tubes
  that can cause solar flares, involves colliding jets that form an
  extended reconnection layer, dissipating magnetic energy and causing
  the two jets to merge. The second, akin to coronal mass ejection
  events, involves the accretion of magnetic field lines onto both
  black holes; these magnetic fields then twist, inflate, and form a
  trailing current sheet, ultimately reconnecting and driving a hot
  outflow. We provide estimates for the associated electromagnetic
  emission for both processes, showing that they likely accelerate
  electrons to high energies and are promising candidates for
  continuous, stochastic, and/or quasi-periodic higher-energy
  electromagnetic emission. We also show that the accretion flows
  around each black hole can display features associated with the
  magnetically arrested state. However, simulations with black hole
  spins misaligned with the orbital plane and simulations with larger
  Bondi radii saturate at lower values of horizon-penetrating magnetic
  flux than standard magnetically arrested disks, leading to weaker,
  intermittent jets owing to feedback from the weak jets or equatorial
  flux tubes ejected by reconnecting field lines near the horizon.

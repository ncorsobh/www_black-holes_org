  We investigate the influence of inelastic neutrino microphysics in
  general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a
  hypermassive neutron star. In particular, we include species/energy
  groups coupled neutrino-matter interactions, such as inelastic
  neutrino-electron scattering and electron-positron annihilation
  kernels, into simulations up to 50 ms. Neutrino-electron inelastic
  scattering is known to have effective neutrino-matter energy
  exchange. We show that, with neutrino-electron inelastic scattering,
  simulations predict 75% higher disc mass with slightly different
  mass-averaged compositions, and 18% more ejected mass with similar
  distributions. The enhancement of the mass of the disc and the
  ejecta results in stronger baryon pollution, leading to less
  favourable jet launching environments. Furthermore, neutrino
  luminosities are about 50, 40, and 30% higher for electron neutrino,
  electron anti-neutrino, and heavy-lepton neutrinos. In contrast, we
  do not see any significant impacts due to electron-positron
  annihilation.
